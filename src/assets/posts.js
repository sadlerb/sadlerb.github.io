    title: "Cubeathon",
    text: "Cubethon was the first full(?) game I made using Unity. The project came from following a tutorial made by Brackeys who went over the basics of creating 3D and 2D games in Unity. Working with Unity was extremely straight forward and intuitive. Overall I had a fairly easy time learing the basics of unity to create this game. There were more than a few suspicious flying boxes here and there but since it did not affect gameplay, it was henceforth considered a feature and no further questions were asked.",

    title: "Pokedex",
    text: "Due to my interest in Pokémon and lack of ability to actually purchase a Pokémon game I did the next best thing and make a Pokémon app. The Pokédex is a moblie application built using Flutter that calls the PokéAPI and displays the name, type, details, and evolutions of each Pokémon. The idea for this project came from mtechviral. This was a joy to work on and it each page looks great too... Except for Eevee. Eevee haunts me.",

    title: "Pong",
    text: "Please ignore the paddels going out of bounds. Poing was basically the first project I decided to do that did not relate to any schoolwork I was doing. I did this a long time ago so I'm not 100% sure where I got the idea from. We just learnt about rendering stuff in Java and I decided I wanted to make Pong. I later tried to make Snake but after realising I would have to be good at math, the project was immediately dropped (I may revist it using html and javascript when I get time).",
